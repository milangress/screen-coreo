# Hi, I am an artist

üüíüüí

I gonna touch on some heavy stuff: genocide, pathology and at times it might also get loud. Feel free to take a break if you need to.

```js
await Wave('intro').load('/panpan1.mp3')
await Wave('intro').play().setVolume(0.5)
```

This presentation is a sort of elopement ‚Äî a üüÄ wandering üüÄ

```js
await new Flux('start').size(50, 50).position(0, 50)
        .content('VideoBlock', { src: 'test.MOV', volume: 0.2 }).open();
```

Wandering üüî like when you can't fall asleep and get out of bed at three.

```js
await new Flux('background')
        .size(100, 100)
        .position(0, 0)
        .video('BusBG.mp4')
        .volume(0.4)
        .open()
```

Wandering üüî like when I was in second grade and I snuck out earlier to hide at the Jewish graveyard just so a very specific shitty 10th grader couldn't find me.

But also üüî wandering ‚Ä¶ like when you are on a first date and it just a bit too awkward or intense for a kiss, but it would also be sad to leave, so you keep walking side by side.


This bus is on The road from Patra to Athina - ‚Äì ‚Äî

But in 10 minutes we will only make it to Arachovitika.

üüî

```js
new Flux('background').filter({ blur: '10px' }).open()
new Flux('house').size(50, 50).position(30, 40)
  .image('house.jpeg').open()
```

Incidentally, it's here where I wrote this text.

We have a complicated relationship ‚Äî 

Arachovitika and I ‚Äî lots of unresolved trauma‚Ä¶ 


```js
new Flux('arachovitika1').size(50, 50).position(0, 50)
  .image('arachovitika1.jpeg').open()
```

and nevertheless so enchanting, 

```js
new Flux('arachovitika2').size(30, 30).position(70, 10)
  .image('arachovitika2.jpeg').open()
```

But somehow I forget it every time‚Ä¶ until I get overwhelmed by the stuff I'm walking away from.

Painfully aware, I'm not at home while also being at home.

Not today, though! Today I'm sitting here.

```js
new Flux('sofa').size(66, 74).position(21, 22).image('Sofa.jpeg').open();
```

Thinking about: how the enlightenment reconfigured the body as mechanics‚Ä¶\
as a matter of functioning.\
Like if you ever go to a German design school, and they tell you your design is functioning, that's their highest praise. 

So I looked for traces, pulled string and followed breadcrumbs through the dark Forrest of the pathology paradigm. The concept of ‚Äúnormality‚Äù and how it has fundamentally shaped our ideas about ability and health. 

Still, I have a hard time imaging a time and thought before it went full hegemonic. And like others, it lead me to Francis Galton, a cousin of Darwin (explains a lot) known for being the founder of many science innovations, eugenics and modern psychology.

```js
await Wave('intro').setVolume(0.2)
await Wave('jets').load('/jets.mp3')
await Wave('jets').play()
new Flux('arachovitika2').close()
new Flux('arachovitika1').close()
new Flux('sofa').close()
new Flux('house').close()

```

Oh, daddy eugenics!

Ohh daddy pathology!

```js
new Flux('background').filter({ blur: '0' }).open()
```

The sky rips open.

Three F-35 Zeus\
Lightning 1 fighter jets\
carve up the sky above us. The supersonic shock wave makes us both dissociate for a bit.

Don't worry, my love! They are not here for us, we are still inside the Empire. We are the good guys.

My mind drifts away. Nature is inescapably present here.
the sun,\
the saltwater,\
the waves,\
and the Wind.\


```js
new Flux('wind').size(38, 69).position(55, 16).video('wind.MOV').volume(0.2).open();
```

The Erosion is inescapably. I watch it every year. 

```js
new Flux('erosion').size(38, 68).position(6, 15).video('erosion.MOV').volume(0.2).open();
```

But somehow it fills me with a strange peace to know that everything I do here will one day be gone.

It hasn't rained since Easter. 

```js
Wave('intro').stop()
new Flux('heat').size(66, 74).position(21, 22).video('heat2.MOV').open();
```
I have never seen it that dry. The Fig tree I planted two years ago has no leaves any more. 

```js
new Flux('figtree').size(66, 74).position(21, 22).video('figtree.MOV').open();
```
The Sun burns, the Salt eats. If I don't give the gate a protective coat every year, it rusts away‚Ä¶ No, it still rusts.

```js
new Flux('sunSign').size(30, 79).position(0, 20).video('sunSign.MOV').open();
```
And every year, another tree erodes and falls into the ocean.

\

But look what I found and look how green the garden was‚Ä¶ how alive

```js
new Flux('heat').close()
new Flux('figtree').close()
new Flux('milan1').size(49, 88).position(51, 4).image('milan1.jpeg').open();
```

Also, yes, yes, I know I had hair in the past‚Ä¶ incredible.

```js
new Flux('sunSign').close()
new Flux('milan2').size(54, 88).position(44, 12).image('milan2.jpeg').open();
new Flux('milan3').size(46, 79).position(0, 21).image('milan3.jpeg').open();
```

At that age, I would get compliments on the bus‚Ä¶ they called me a pretty girl. That was Nice. 

It took me a few years to internalize the shame and understand that being called a girl should be understood as a gave insult.


```js
await Wave('ImasteDio').load('/ImasteDio.mp3')
Wave('ImasteDio').play().setVolume(0.5)
```

Also, look what I found: my grandfather was running as a politician.

```js
new Flux('papu').size(30, 84).position(6, 12).image('papu-pasok.png').open();
```

Just once

He was a partisan during the ‚Äúrevolution‚Äù against the military dictatorship of Papadopoulos. 

```js
new Flux('milan2').close()
new Flux('milan3').close()
new Flux('milan1').close()
new Wave('ImasteDio').setVolume(1)
```

Imaste Dio
There are two,\
there are two of us,\
there are two, \
there are three of us,\
there are a thousand and thirteen of us.\
Or as Shrine would say: In Amsterdam you don't have to give notice if your protest is three people or fewer.


Anyway, I learned a new story this summer.
You know, after the revolution there was a massive party at Panachaikos Gymnastikos a stadium in Patra. Everybody was so excited.\
But my grandfather.\
Dhimos‚Ä¶\
It was too loud for him‚Ä¶\
And too many people‚Ä¶\

```js
new Flux('papu').close()
```
```js
Wave('ImasteDio').setVolume(0.4)
```

But It left me wondering how our revolution will look‚Ä¶ our after party ‚Ä¶ who joins and who goes home. Who can access and who is excluded. 

If you want to join‚Ä¶ we are working on the revolution right now. 

```js
new Flux('quak').size(38, 84).position(59, 6).image('quak.jpeg').open();
```

We met last year as a neuroqueer group through the radical Sunday school at Joe's Garage here in Amsterdam. And while I was away, we grew from 5 to 25 people.

Also, don't get scared by the revolution: 
our revolution has to be accessible.

Building community‚Ä¶ 
Sharing our pain ‚Äî and our joy with each other ‚Äî IS the revolution.

In the same note, the Sandberg queer group ran out of funding. But we are still continuing. join.

OK, now I need to show you something:

It's an older add from Autism Speaks. The biggest autism advocacy group in the world.

I just added some music to make it less scary.

```js

```
--- 

I am autism.
I‚Äôm visible in your children, but if I can help it, I am invisible to you until it‚Äôs too late.
I know where you live.
And guess what? I live there too.
I hover around all of you.
I know no color barrier, no religion, no morality, no currency.
I speak your language fluently.
And with every voice I take away, I acquire yet another language.
I work very quickly.
I work faster than pediatric aids, cancer, and diabetes combined
And if you‚Äôre happily married, I will make sure that your marriage fails.
Your money will fall into my hands, and I will bankrupt you for my own self-gain.
I don‚Äôt sleep, so I make sure you don‚Äôt either.
I will make it virtually impossible for your family to easily attend a temple, birthday party, or public park without a struggle, without embarrassment, without pain.
You have no cure for me.
Your scientists don‚Äôt have the resources, and I relish their desperation. Your neighbors are happier to pretend that I don‚Äôt exist‚Äîof course, until it‚Äôs their child.
I am autism. I have no interest in right or wrong. I derive great pleasure out of your loneliness.
I will fight to take away your hope. I will plot to rob you of your children and your dreams. I will make sure that every day you wake up you will cry, wondering who will take care of my child after I die?
And the truth is, I am still winning, and you are scared. And you should be.
I am autism. You ignored me. That was a mistake.

---

We stop here because now they start talking about the eradication of autism. And I Don't like that part.

Oh, yeah, btw. 1st years all of what I'm talking about is autism and neurodivergence. Don't get tricked by my winding metaphors and stories, I'm just wrapping the trauma dumping in more narration.

If you hear eradication of autism, and your alarm bells don't go off, ‚Üí let's imagen if black lives matter fought for the eradication of black people. Fucked Up. No

Oh, daddy Pathology

Oh, daddy Eugenics

Oh, daddy genocide




ausl√∂schung‚Ä¶

I was back in Kalanos and Kalawrita in the mountains. Where my grandfather grew up.

```js
new Flux('kalavrita1').size(80, 80).position(20, 20).video('kalavrita1.MOV').open();
```

During the Kawritan holocaust, all men over 13 were rounded up and shot, while the women and children were imprisoned into the school which was burned down together with the whole village. 

```js
new Flux('kalavrita2').size(26, 59).position(3, 8).image('kalavrita.jpeg').open();
```

Oh, daddy genocide

Oh, daddy pathology

You know, the German military treats it to this day as a normal fight against communist partisans and the burning school was just an accident‚Ä¶ My great grandpa was, in fact, a communist partisan, but he was hiding in another village at the time.

I know‚Ä¶ I know‚Ä¶ it's a family thing now. And men rather die in a revolution than go to therapy. In a way, it's even worse when your emotionally distant dad has a reason and a good excuse, you know?



Ahhh
Herr Doktor, Herr Doktor, bitte!

```js
new Flux('sofa').size(80, 80).position(10, 10).image('Sofa.jpeg').open();
```

I'm not sure any more? On with side of the Empire am I standing? I think they called my grandfather a terrorist.

The Empire is expanding.\
And you may not simply walk away from Omelas.

```js
new Flux('kalavrita1').close()
new Flux('kalavrita2').close()
new Flux('sofa').close()
new Wave('bells').load('/bells.m4a')
new Wave('bells').play().setVolume(0.2)
```

Yes, We are all part of the Empire.\
I am to!\
I was born inside the Empire.\
And tragically, I am too ‚Äî a fierce warrior of its borders\
The Empire of normality.\
Our collective weapon is shame.

No, No, No, I was born outside the Empire.\
But I fought my whole life to get in.\
And neatly redraw its borders around me\
just so, it excludes the even more other.\

Oh, daddy, I think I want to become a shame terrorist when I grow up.

```js
new Wave('bells').stop()
await new Wave('trashcollector').load('/trashcollector1.m4a')
new Wave('trashcollector').play().setVolume(0.2)
```

So I'm becoming autistic.

That's from my current Thesis working title:

```js
new Flux('thesisTitel').size(43, 41).position(54, 5).image('thesisTitel.jpeg').open();
```

becoming autistic

not homecoming

not overcoming

I know there is tension. Even today, I was almost sketching a genealogy (in the literal sense) of (my) autism. And yes, I don't have autism.


(now that would have been a funny twist, no?)


I don't have autism. I am autistic! It's not a Balenciaga bag I can leave at home because I'm scared your grabby dirty fingers mean I can't sell it on Grailed afterwards. 
Your fingers gonna touch my autism and I guess we both have to live with that.

```js
new Flux('thesisTitel').close()
new Flux('strongWaves').size(100, 100).position(0, 0).video('strongWaves1.MOV').volume(0.3).open();
```

But it's very much not an essentialist ‚Äúborn this way‚Äù argument. This only ever serves in supporting cic- het- neuronormativety and stabilizing the status quo. And no, being compliant does not mean they will support you. Believe me, I tried.

So no you are not born this way.

My love, you have to understand: this was always just a fantasy of yours.

Watch me\
I will Turn your kids autistic and queer.

Watch the Sun\
as it burns down on everything you own

```js
new Flux('strongWaves').video('strongWaves3.MOV').volume(0.3).open();
```

Watch the See\
One day, It will destroy all the walls your grandparents built.

Watch the Salt\
As it slowly eats away and dismantles the master's house.

PS: What comes after Brat summer? Brat Autism!

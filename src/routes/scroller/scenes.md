# Hi so i am a artist

üüíüüí

I gonna touch on some heavy stuff: genocide, pathology
so feel free to detach or even leave this space if it gets too much.

```js
await MyAudio('intro').load('test.m4a')
await MyAudio('intro').play()
```
.

.

.

.

```js
await new MyWindow('start')
        .size(50, 50)
        .position(0, 50)
        .content('VideoBlock', { src: 'test.MOV' })
        .open();
```

This presentation is a sort of elopement ‚Äî a wandering

Wandering üüî like when you can't fall asleep and get out of bed at three.

Wandering üüî like when I was in second grade and I snuck out earlier to hide at the Jewish graveyard (because it was always empty there) so a very specific shitty 16-year-old guy wouldn't find me.

But also üüî wandering like when you are on a first date and it just a bit too awkward or intense for a kiss, but it would also be sad to leave, so you keep walking side by side.

```js
await new MyWindow('background')
        .size(100, 100)
        .position(0, 0)
        .content('VideoBlock', { src: 'BusBG.mp4' })
        .open()
```

This bus is on The way from Patra to Athina - ‚Äì ‚Äî
But in 10 minutes we will just make it to Arachovitika.

```js
new MyWindow('background').filter({ blur: '10px' }).open()
new MyWindow('house').size(50, 50).position(30, 40)
  .content('ImageBlock', { src: 'house.jpeg' }).open()
```

Incidentally, it's here where I wrote this text

We have a complicated relationship. 

Arachovitika and i‚Ä¶ lots of unresolved trauma 


```js
new MyWindow('arachovitika1').size(50, 50).position(0, 50)
  .content('ImageBlock', { src: 'arachovitika1.jpeg' }).open()
```

and nevertheless so enchanting, 

```js
new MyWindow('arachovitika2').size(30, 30).position(70, 10)
  .content('ImageBlock', { src: 'arachovitika2.jpeg' }).open()
```

But somehow I forget it every time‚Ä¶ unprepared and frolicking until I get overwhelmed by the stuff I'm walking away from.

Painfully aware, I'm not at home while also being at home.

Not today, though! Today I'm sitting here.

```js
new MyWindow('sofa').size(66, 74).position(21, 22).content('ImageBlock', {"src":"Sofa.jpeg"}).open();
```

Thinking about: how the enlightenment reconfigured the body as mechanics‚Ä¶ as a matter of functioning. You know, if you ever go to a German design school, and they tell you your design is functioning, that's high praise. So I looked for traces, pulled string and followed breadcrumbs through the dark Forrest of the pathology paradigm. The concept of ‚Äúnormality‚Äù and how it has fundamentally shaped our ideas about ability and health. 

Still, I have a hard time imaging a time and thought before it went full hegemonic. And like others, it leads me to Francis Galton, a cousin of Darwin (tbh explains a lot) known for being the founder of many science innovations eugenics and modern psychology.

```js
await MyAudio('jets').load('jets.mp3')
await MyAudio('jets').play()
```

Oh, daddy eugenics!

Ohh daddy pathology!


The sky rips open.

Three F-35 Zeus\
Lightning 1 fighter jets\
carve up the sky above us. The supersonic shock wave makes us both dissociate for a bit.

Don't worry, my love! They are not here for us, we are still inside the Empire. We are the good guys.

My mind drifts away. Nature is inescapably present here.
the sun,\
the saltwater,\
the waves,\
and the Wind.\


```js
new MyWindow('wind').size(66, 74).position(21, 22).content('VideoBlock', {"src":"wind.MOV"}).open();
```

The Erosion is inescapably. I watch it every year. 

```js
new MyWindow('erosion').size(66, 74).position(21, 22).content('VideoBlock', {"src":"erosion.MOV"}).open();
```

But somehow it fills me with a strange peace to know that everything I do here will one day be gone.

It hasn't rained since Easter. 

```js
new MyWindow('heat').size(66, 74).position(21, 22).content('VideoBlock', {"src":"heat2.MOV"}).open();
```

I have never seen it that dry. The Fig tree I planted two years ago has no leaves any more. 

```js
new MyWindow('figtree').size(66, 74).position(21, 22).content('VideoBlock', {"src":"figtree.MOV"}).open();
```

The Sun burns, the Salt eats. If I don't give the gate a protective coat every year, it rusts away‚Ä¶ No, it still rusts.

```js
new MyWindow('sunSign').size(66, 74).position(21, 22).content('VideoBlock', {"src":"sunSign.MOV"}).open();
```

Every year, another tree erodes and falls into the ocean. The wall my grandfather built is more concerned with holding itself together than protecting anything.

\

But look what I found and look how green the garden was‚Ä¶ how alive

```js
new MyWindow('milan1').size(66, 74).position(21, 22).content('ImageBlock', {"src":"milan1.jpeg"}).open();
```

Also, yes, yes, I know I had hair in the past‚Ä¶ incredible.

```js
new MyWindow('milan2').size(80, 50).position(21, 22).content('ImageBlock', {"src":"milan2.jpeg"}).open();
new MyWindow('milan3').size(50, 100).position(21, 22).content('ImageBlock', {"src":"milan3.jpeg"}).open();
```

At that age, I would get compliments on the bus‚Ä¶ they called me a pretty girl. That was Nice. 

It took me a few years to internalize the shame and understand that being called a girl should be understood as a gave insult.


```js
await MyAudio('ImasteDio').load('ImasteDio.mp3')
MyAudio('ImasteDio').play().setVolume(0.5)
```

Also, look what I found: my grandfather was running as a politician.

```js
new MyWindow('papu').size(80, 50).position(21, 22).content('ImageBlock', {"src":"papu-pasok.png"}).open();
```

Just once

He was a partisan during the ‚Äúrevolution‚Äù against the military dictatorship of Papadopoulos. 

```js
MyAudio('ImasteDio').setVolume(1)
```

Imaste Dio
There are two,\
there are two of us,\
there are two, \
there are three of us,\
there are a thousand and thirteen of us.\
Or as Shrine would say: In Amsterdam you don't have to give notice if your protest is three people or fewer.


Anyway, I learned a new story this summer.
You know, after the revolution there was a massive party at Panachaikos Gymnastikos a stadium in Patra. Everybody was so excited.\
But my grandfather.\
Dhimos‚Ä¶\
It was too loud for him‚Ä¶\
And too many people‚Ä¶\

I'm not sure if you can relate how strange that is in Greek society. Even here, skipping the party you went to prison for would be strange, but in Greece‚Ä¶‚Ä¶

```js
MyAudio('ImasteDio').setVolume(0.4)
```

But It left me wondering how our revolution will look‚Ä¶ our after party ‚Ä¶ who joins and who goes home. Who can access and who is excluded. 

If you want to join‚Ä¶ we are working on the revolution right now. 

```js
new MyWindow('quak').size(38, 84).position(59, 6).content('ImageBlock', {"src":"quak.jpeg","id":"quak"}).open();
```

We met last year as a neuroqueer group through the radical Sunday school at Joe's Garage here in Amsterdam. And while I was away, we grew from 5 to 25 people. Menko joined btw through a whole chain of people I didn't know, so we will continue in building ramps and holding space.

Also, don't get scared by the revolution: 
our revolution has to be accessible.

Building community‚Ä¶ 

Sharing our pain ‚Äî and our joy with each other ‚Äî IS the revolution.

In the same note, the Sandberg queer group ran out of funding (at least for now) so we are seeking people who can give a bit of time and energy so we can continue. Either way, you are also VERY welcome here. Even if you only come for the fun part. :)

OK, now I need to show you something:

It's an older add from Autism Speaks. The biggest autism advocacy group in the world.

I just added some music to make it less scary.

We stop here because now they start talking about the eradication of autism. And I Don't like that part.

Oh, yeah, btw. all of what I'm talking about is autism and neurodivergence. Don't get tricked by my winding metaphors and stories, I'm just wrapping the trauma dumping in more narration.

If you hear eradication of autism, and your alarm bells don't go off, ‚Üí let's Imagen if black lives matter fought for the eradication of black people. Fucked Up. No

Oh, daddy Pathology

Oh, daddy Eugenics

Oh, daddy genocide

I was back in Kalanos and Kalawrita in the mountains. Where my grandfather grew up.

```js
new MyWindow('kalavrita1').size(80, 80).position(20, 20).content('VideoBlock', {"src":"kalavrita1.MOV"}).open();
```

During the Kawritan holocaust, all men over 13 were rounded up and shot, while the women and children were imprisoned into the school which was burned down together with the whole village. 

```js
new MyWindow('kalavrita2').size(80, 80).position(20, 20).content('ImageBlock', {"src":"kalavrita.jpeg"}).open();
```

Oh, daddy genocide

Oh, daddy pathology

You know, the German military treats it to this day as a normal fight against communist partisans and the burning school was just an accident‚Ä¶ My great grandpa was, in fact, a communist partisan, but he was hiding in another village at the time.

I know‚Ä¶ I know‚Ä¶ it's a family thing now. And men rather die in a revolution than go to therapy. In a way, it's even worse when your emotionally distant dad has a reason and a good excuse, you know?

Ahhh
Herr Doktor, Herr Doktor, bitte!
I'm not sure any more? On with side of the Empire am I standing? I think they called my grandfather a terrorist.

The Empire is expanding.\
And you may not simply walk away from Omelas.

Yes, We are all part of the Empire.\
I am to!\
I was born inside the Empire.\
And tragically, I am too ‚Äî a fierce warrior of its borders\
The Empire of normality.\
Our collective weapon is shame.

No, No, No, I was born outside the Empire.\
But I fought my whole life to get in.\
And neatly redraw its borders around me\
just so, it excludes the even more other.\

Oh, daddy, I think I want to become a shame terrorist when I grow up.

So I'm becoming autistic.

That's from my current Thesis working title:

```js
new MyWindow('thesisTitel').size(66, 74).position(21, 22).content('ImageBlock', {"src":"thesisTitel.jpeg"}).open();
```

becoming autistic

not homecoming

not overcoming

I know there is tension. Even today, I was almost sketching a genealogy (in the literal sense) of my autism. And yes, I don't have autism.

.

(now that would have been a funny twist, no?)


I don't have autism. I am autistic! It's not a Balenciaga bag I can leave at home because I'm scared your dirty fingers mean I can't sell it on Grailed afterwards. 
Your fingers gonna touch my autism and I guess we both have to fine with that.

But it's very much not an essentialist ‚Äúborn this way‚Äù argument. This only ever serves in supporting cic- het- neuronormativety and stabilizing the status quo. And no, being compliant does not mean they support you it just hurts you. Believe me, I tried.

So no you are not born this way.

My love, you have to understand: this was always just a fantasy of yours.

Watch me
I will Turn your kids autistic and queer.

Watch the Sun 
as it burns down on everything you own

Watch the See
One day, It will destroy all the walls your grandparents built.

Watch the Salt
As it slowly eats away and dismantles the master's house.

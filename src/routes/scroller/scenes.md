# Hi so i am a artist

I gonna touch on some heavy stuff: genocide, pathology
so feel free to detach or even leave this space if it gets too much.



```js
await new MyWindow('start')
        .size(50, 50)
        .position(0, 50)
        .content('BackgroundVideo', { src: 'test.MOV' })
        .open();
```

This presentation is a sort of elopement — a wandering

Wandering like when you can't fall asleep and get out of bed at three.

```js
MyAudio('background').load('test.m4a')
```
-

--

-

```js
MyAudio('background').play()
```

-

--

-

```js
MyAudio('background').volume(0.5)
```

Wandering, like when I was in second grade and I snuck out earlier to hide at the Jewish graveyard (because it was always empty there) so a very specific shitty 16-year-old guy wouldn't find me.

But also wandering like when you are on a first date and it just a bit too awkward or intense for a kiss, but it would also be sad to leave, so you keep walking side by side.

```js
await new MyWindow('background')
        .size(100, 100)
        .position(0, 50)
        .content('BackgroundVideo', { src: 'BusBG.mp4' })
        .open();
```

This bus is on the way from Patra to Athina
but in 10 minutes we will just make it to Arachovitika

Incidentally, where I wrote this text

We have complicated relationship Arachovitika and i… lots of unresolved trauma and nevertheless so enchanting, but somehow I forget that every time… unprepared and froloking until I get overwhelmed by the stuff I'm walking away from.

Painfully aware, I'm not at home while also being at home.

Not today, though! Today I'm sitting here thinking about:

…

Oh, daddy eugenics!

Ohh daddy pathology!

The sky rips open.

Three F-35 Zeus Lightning 1 fighter jets carve up the sky above us. The supersonic shock wave makes us both dissociate for a bit.

Don't worry, my love! They are not here for us, we are still inside the Empire. We are the good guys, remember.

My mind drifts away. Nature is inescapably present here.
The sun, The saltwater, the waves, and the Wind. The Erosion is inescapably. I watch it every year. It fills me with a strange peace to know that everything I do here will one day be gone.

It hasn't rained since Easter. I have never seen it that dry. The Fig tree I planted two years ago has no leaves anymore. The Sun burns, the Salt eats. If I don't give the gate a protective coat every year, it rusts away… No, it still rusts.
Every year, another tree falls into the ocean. The wall my grandfather built is more concerned with holding itself together than protecting anything.

I searched for old pictures because I wanted to see how the garden looked in the past.

Yes, Yes, I know I had hair in the past… incredible.
At that age, I would get compliments on the bus… they called me a pretty girl. That was Nice. 
It took me roughly a year to internalize the shame and understand that being called a girl should be understood as a gave insult.

I found This Image: my grandfather was running as a politician.
Just once
he was a partisan during the revolution → against the military dictatorship of Papadopoulos. 

Mikis Theodorakis - Imaste Dio
There are two, there are two of us,
there are two, there are three of us,
there are a thousand and thirteen of us
Or as Shrine would say: In Amsterdam you don't have to give notice if your protest is three people or fewer.


Anyway I learned a new story this summer.
You know, after the revolution there was a massive party at Panachaikos Gymnastikos a stadium in Patra. Everybody was so excited. 
But my grandfather. Dimitri…
It was too loud for him… and too many people. I'm not sure if you can relate how strange that is in Greek society. Even here, skipping the party you went to prison for would be strange, but in Greece……

But It left me wondering how our revolution will look… our after party … who joins and who goes home. Who can access and who is excluded. 

If you want to join… we are working on the revolution right now. We met last year through the radical Sunday school at Joes Garage her in Amsterdam and while I was away, we grew from 5 to 25 people. Menko joined btw through a whole chain of people I didn't know, so we will continue in building ramps and holding space.

Also, don't get scared by the revolution talk: 
our revolution has to be accessible.
building community… 
sharing our pain… 
and our joy with each other 
IS the revolution.

In the same note the Sandberg queer group ran out of funding (at least for now) so we are seeking people who can give a bit of time and energy so we can continue. Either way, you are also VERY welcome here. Even if you only come for the fun part. :)


Ok, now I need to show you something:

autism speaks

…

We stop here because now they start talking about the eradication of autism. And i Dont like that part.
Oh yeah btw. all of what im talking about is about autism and neurodivergence. Dont get tricked by my winding metaphores and stories im just wrapping the trauma dumping in more naration.

If you hear eradication of autism and you alarmbells dont go off → lets imagen if black lives matter would fight for the eradication of black people. Fucked Up. No

Oh daddy Pathology
Oh daddy Eugenics
Oh daddy genocide

auslöschung…
I was back in kalanos and kalawrita in the mountains. where my gradfather grew up. The best Feta you will ever taste in my opinon. 

During the kawritan holocaust all men over 13 where round up and shot while the women and children where imprisond into the schooll witch was burnd down together the whole vilage. 

Oh daddy genocide

You know, the German military treats it to this day as a normal fight against communist partisans and the burning school was just an accident… My great grandpa was, in fact, a communist partisan, but he was hiding in another village at the time.

I know… I know… it's a family thing now. And men rather dying in a revolution than going to therapy. In a way, it's even worse when your emotionally distant dad has a reason and a good excuse, you know?

Ahhh
Herr Doktor, Herr Doktor, bitte.
I'm not sure anymore? On with side of the empire I'm standing? I think they called my grandfather a terrorist.

The empire is expanding

Yes, We are all part of the empire.
I am to!
I was born inside the empire.
And tragically, I am too — a fierce warrior of its borders
The empire of normality.
Our collective weapon is shame.

No, No, No, I was born outside the empire.
But I fought my whole life to get in.
And redraw its borders around me
just so, it excludes the even more other.

Oh, dady I think I want to become a shame terrorist when I grow up.

Thesis title


don't have am
not a Balenciaga bag I can leave at home because I'm scared your dirt finger will touch  it.


essencialismus
queer

born this way

My love, but you have to understand: this was always just a fantasy of yours

Watch me
I will Turn your kids autistic and queer.
Watch the Sun 
as it burns down on everything you own
Watch the See
One day, It will destroy all the walls your grandparents built.
Watch the Salt
As it slowly eats away and dismantles the master's house.

My Love… no empire survived persistent erosion. 
Even the Empire will fall one day

Two Dimensional Man by Paul Sahre
It's a memoir… from Sahre a designer but the book is mostly a deeply personal story. It was realy nice. It made me rember why I fell in love with design. It took me back to when design was exiting. You know, before design thinking and human centered design.

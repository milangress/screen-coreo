# Hi, I am an artist

(The joke lies in what I say vs what you see)

üüíüüí

This work in many ways evolved from the work I performed at Salim's class last year.

```js
await new Flux('salim1').size(50, 50).position(0, 50)
        .video('wrong-side-seg1.mp4').volume(0.2).open();
```

Using a series of browser popups to talk about what I was up to.
It was right after Christmas and full of melancholic sad girl vibes. This one, maybe not.

I also introduced you to "pasatempos" the Greek word for sunflower seeds. As a practice of stimming‚Ä¶ of collectively passing time. And also a cultural practice that demarcate borders.


```js
await new Flux('salim1').size(70, 70).position(20, 10)
        .video('wrong-side-seg2.mp4').volume(0.2).open();
```

And because we like these repetitions and echoes and echolalias in my corner of reality. I'll like to share this with you again.

The tech I‚Äôm working with here is also a repetition but also quite different. 

```js
await new Flux('ScenesMdBlock').size(80, 80).position(20, 10).content('ScenesMdBlock').open();
```

At its core is this scrip I'm reading from. Interwoven with pieces of code that are executed when they appear on the screen. Not fully readable but It's still there.

```js
await Wave('intro').load('/panpan1.mp3')
await Wave('intro').play().setVolume(0.5)
```

This presentation is a sort of elopement ‚Äî a üüÄ wandering üüÄ

```js
await new Flux('start').size(50, 50).position(0, 50)
        .video('test.MOV').volume(0.2).open();
```

Wandering üüî like when you can't fall asleep and get out of bed at three.

```js
await new Flux('background')
        .size(100, 100)
        .position(0, 0)
        .video('BusBG.mp4')
        .volume(0.4)
        .open()
```

But also üüî wandering ‚Ä¶ like when you are on a first date and it just a bit too awkward or intense for a kiss, but it would also be sad to leave, so you keep walking side by side.

üüî

This bus is on the road from Patra to Athina - ‚Äì ‚Äî

But in 10 minutes we will only make it to Arachovitika.

üüî

```js
new Flux('background').filter({ blur: '10px' }).open()
new Flux('house').size(50, 50).position(30, 40)
  .image('house.jpeg').open()
```

Incidentally, it's here where I wrote this text.

We have a complicated relationship ‚Äî 

Arachovitika and I ‚Äî lots of unresolved trauma‚Ä¶ 


```js
new Flux('arachovitika1').size(50, 50).position(0, 50)
  .image('arachovitika1.jpeg').open()
```

and nevertheless so enchanting, 

```js
new Flux('arachovitika2').size(30, 30).position(70, 10)
  .image('arachovitika2.jpeg').open()
```

But somehow I forget it every time‚Ä¶ until I get overwhelmed by the stuff I'm walking away from.

Painfully aware, I'm not at home while also being at home.

```js
new Flux('sofa').size(66, 74).position(21, 22).image('Sofa.jpeg').open();
```

Although not today. Today, I'm lying here‚Ä¶ thinking:\
how the enlightenment reconfigured the body as mechanics‚Ä¶ as a machine‚Ä¶\
As a matter of functioning.\
Even today, if you ever go to a German design school, and they tell you your design is functioning, that's their highest praise. 

So I looked for traces, pulled string and followed breadcrumbs through the dark Forrest of the pathology paradigm. The concept of ‚Äúnormality‚Äù and how it has fundamentally shaped our ideas about ability and health. 

Still, I have a hard time imaging a time and thought before it went full hegemonic. And like others, it leads me to Francis Galton, a cousin of Darwin (somehow not a surprise) known for being the founder of many science innovations, modern psychology and eugenics.

```js
await Wave('intro').setVolume(0.2)
await Wave('jets').load('/jets.mp3')
await Wave('jets').play()
new Flux('arachovitika2').close()
new Flux('arachovitika1').close()
new Flux('sofa').close()
new Flux('house').close()

```

Oh, daddy eugenics!

Ohh daddy pathology!

```js
new Flux('background').filter({ blur: '0' }).open()
```

The sky rips open.

Three F-35 Zeus\
Lightning 1 fighter jets\
carve up the sky above us. The supersonic shock wave makes us both dissociate for a bit.

Don't worry, my love! They are not here for us, we are still inside the Empire. We are the good guys.

My mind drifts away. Nature is inescapably present here.
the sun,\
the saltwater,\
the waves,\
and the Wind.\


```js
new Flux('wind').size(38, 69).position(55, 16).video('wind.MOV').volume(0.2).open();
```

The Erosion here is inescapably. I watch its curse every year. 

```js
new Flux('erosion').size(38, 68).position(6, 15).video('erosion.MOV').volume(0.2).open();
```

But somehow it fills me with a strange peace to know that everything I do here will one day be gone.

You know, it hasn't rained since Easter. 

```js
Wave('intro').stop()
new Flux('heat').size(66, 74).position(21, 22).video('heat2.MOV').open();
```
I have never seen it that dry. The Fig tree I planted two years ago has no leaves any more. 

```js
new Flux('figtree').size(66, 74).position(21, 22).video('figtree.MOV').open();
```
The Sun burns, the Salt eats. 

```js
new Flux('sunSign').size(30, 79).position(0, 20).video('sunSign.MOV').open();
```
And every year, another tree erodes and falls into the ocean.

\

But look what I found and look how green the garden was‚Ä¶ how alive

```js
new Flux('heat').close()
new Flux('figtree').close()
new Flux('milan1').size(49, 88).position(51, 4).image('milan1.jpeg').open();
```

Also, yes, yes, I know I had hair in the past‚Ä¶ incredible.

```js
new Flux('sunSign').close()
new Flux('milan2').size(54, 88).position(44, 12).image('milan2.jpeg').open();
new Flux('milan3').size(46, 79).position(0, 21).image('milan3.jpeg').open();
```

At that age, I would get compliments on the bus‚Ä¶ they called me a pretty girl. 

That was Nice. 

It took me a few years to internalize the shame and understand that being called a girl should be understood as a gave insult.


```js
await Wave('ImasteDio').load('/ImasteDio.mp3')
Wave('ImasteDio').play().setVolume(0.5)
```

Also, look what I found: my grandfather was running as a politician.

```js
new Flux('papu').size(30, 84).position(6, 12).image('papu-pasok.png').open();
```

Just once

He was a partisan during the revolution against the military dictatorship of Papadopoulos. 

```js
new Flux('milan2').close()
new Flux('milan3').close()
new Flux('milan1').close()
new Wave('ImasteDio').setVolume(1)
```

Imaste Dio
There are two,\
there are two of us,\
there are two, \
there are three of us,\
there are a thousand and thirteen of us.\
Or as Shrine would say: In Amsterdam you don't have to give notice if your protest is three people or fewer.


Anyway, my family shared a new story this summer.
You know, after the revolution, there was this massive party. Everybody was so excited.\
But my grandfather.\
Dhimos‚Ä¶\
It was too loud for him‚Ä¶\
And too many people‚Ä¶\
So he left‚Ä¶

I'm not sure if you can comprehend how alien and strange that was in Greek society.

```js
new Flux('papu').close()
```
```js
Wave('ImasteDio').setVolume(0.4)
```

And It left me wondering how our revolution will look‚Ä¶ our after party ‚Ä¶ who joins and who goes home. Who can access and who is excluded. 

Jet again working on the revolution liked right now. 

```js
new Flux('quak').size(38, 84).position(59, 6).image('quak.jpeg').open();
```

My Love, don't get scared by the term revolution: 
We dream of a different one. An accessible one. You know, the people we fight with and for‚Ä¶ they have to survive.

You know‚Ä¶ Building community‚Ä¶ 
Sharing our pain ‚Äî and our joy with each other ‚Äî IS the revolution.

Oh, before I forget: I wanted to show you something:

It's an older add from Autism Speaks. The biggest autism advocacy group in the world.

I just added some music to make it less scary.

I stop here because now they start talking about the eradication of autism. And I Don't like that part.
Eradication of autism‚Ä¶ just imagine if black lives matter fought for the eradication of black people. Fucked Up. No

Oh, daddy Pathology

Oh, daddy Eugenics

Oh, daddy genocide




ausl√∂schung‚Ä¶

I was back in Kalanos and Kalawrita in the mountains. Where my grandfather grew up.

```js
new Flux('kalavrita1').size(80, 80).position(20, 20).video('kalavrita1.MOV').open();
```

During the Kawritan holocaust, all men over 13 were rounded up and shot, while the women and children were imprisoned into the school which was burned down together with the whole village. 

```js
new Flux('kalavrita2').size(26, 59).position(3, 8).image('kalavrita.jpeg').open();
```

Oh, daddy genocide

Oh, daddy pathology

You know, the German military treats it to this day as a normal fight against communist partisans. And understandably, they have to be fought.

I know‚Ä¶ I know‚Ä¶ it's also a family thing now. And men rather die in a revolution than go to therapy. In a way, it's even worse when your emotionally distant dad has a reason and a good excuse, you know?



Ahhh
Herr Doktor, Herr Doktor, bitte!

```js
new Flux('sofa').size(80, 80).position(10, 10).image('Sofa.jpeg').open();
```

I'm not sure any more? On which side of the Empire am I standing? I think they called my grandfather a terrorist.

‚Äî

The Empire is expanding.\
And you may not simply walk away from Omelas.

```js
new Flux('kalavrita1').close()
new Flux('kalavrita2').close()
new Flux('sofa').close()
new Wave('bells').load('/bells.m4a')
new Wave('bells').play().setVolume(0.2)
```

Yes, We are all part of the Empire.\
I am to!\
I was born inside the Empire.\
And tragically, I am too ‚Äî a fierce warrior of its borders\
The Empire of normality.\
Our collective weapon is shame.

No, No, No, I was born outside the Empire.\
But I fought my whole life to get in.\
And neatly redraw its borders around me\
just so, it excludes the even more other.\

Oh, daddy, I think I want to become a shame terrorist when I grow up.

new Wave('bells').stop()
await new Wave('trashcollector').load('/trashcollector1.m4a')

So currently I'm trying to become autistic.

That's from my current Thesis working title:

```js
new Flux('thesisTitel').size(43, 41).position(54, 5).image('thesisTitel.jpeg').open();
```

becoming autistic

not homecoming

not overcoming

I know there is tension. Even **today,** I was almost sketching a genealogy (also in the literal sense) of autism of my autism. But jet, I don't have autism.


(now that would have been a funny twist, no?)


I don't have autism. I am autistic! It's not a Balenciaga bag I can leave at home because I'm scared of your grubby dirty fingers, and that I can't sell it on Grailed afterwards. (the bag)
Your fingers going to touch my autism and I guess we both have to live with that.

```js
new Flux('thesisTitel').close()
new Flux('strongWaves').size(100, 100).position(0, 0).video('strongWaves1.MOV').volume(0.3).open();
```

I am! But it's very much not an essentialist ‚Äúborn this way‚Äù argument. This only ever serves in supporting cic- het- neuronormativety and stabilizing the status quo. And no, being compliant does not mean they will support you. Believe me, I tried.

So no, you are not born this way.

My love, you have to understand: this was always just a fantasy of yours. I know It makes reality easier to live in. But you are continuously and ever becoming.

Watch me\
I will turn your kids autistic and queer.

Watch the Sun\
as it burns down on everything you own

```js
new Flux('strongWaves').video('strongWaves3.MOV').volume(0.3).open();
```

Watch the See\
One day, It will destroy all the walls your grandparents built.

Watch the Salt\
As it slowly eats away and dismantles the master's house.

\

love
Milan <3

PS: What comes after Brat summer? Brat Autism!
